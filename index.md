# Welcome to My Academic Portfolio ðŸŽ“

Hi, I'm **Christopher Santorelli**, a PhD student studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

## ðŸ”¬ Research
<!-- - [ Few-shot is all you need... but RAG is the Cherry on Top]() - *Eamon Worden, Sami Baral, Daniel Yu, Christopher Santorelli and Neil Heffernan*-->
- [Automated Feedback in Math Education: A Comparative Analysis of LLMs for Open-Ended Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08910v1) - *Sami Baral, Eamon Worden, Wen-Chiang Lim, Zhuang Luo, Christopher Santorelli, Ashish Gurung, Neil Heffernan.* This study evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in providing automated feedback for middle-school math education by comparing Llama (Mistral), SBERT-Canberra, and GPT-4 in scoring accuracy and qualitative feedback, using teacher judgments to assess their performance and potential for personalized learning.
